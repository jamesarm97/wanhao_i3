Description: Replacement Wanhao I3 controller backplate with two 40mm fan cutouts for better airflow. 

Instructions: I laser cut mine out of 5mm acrylic and counter sunk the screw holes (with drill in reverse) to allow the original screws to be used. Mount one or two (I did one in the top slot for the electronics) 40mm fans (12V) orientated to pull air into the box and wire to the spare COM and V+ power on the DC power supply.
